# RB_MAGA
A control interface and modification of RB 3D Overlay to make it friendly for active gaming.

MAGA was "Metal's Active Gaming Assistant", no affiliation with any political movements, and this was created before such "movements" existed.

_Overlay credits: The Buddy Team & ZZI_  
_I did not create the overlay, just the WPF settings form and controls to hook into their code to provide a finer level of tuning to the overlay._
